A multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic 3D environments. Drones, obstacles, and targets are modeled as a dynamic spatial graph processed by a **Graph Transformer with Continuous Distance-Biased Soft Masking**. A Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE / MAPPO) policy controls multi-drone navigation while exposing multi-head attention weights for interpretability and post-hoc decision explainability.

## 1. Overview

Autonomous multi-UAV navigation in congested or obstacle-rich 3D airspaces presents significant coordination and safety challenges. Traditional methods using flattened vectors (MLP) or fixed-resolution grids (CNN) do not scale seamlessly to varying fleet sizes and dynamic obstacle counts.

This framework solves these challenges through:
- **Dynamic Graph Representation**: Variable numbers of drones, obstacles, and targets are encoded as nodes in a unified spatial graph.
- **Relational Reasoning via Graph Transformer**: Nodes communicate via multi-head self-attention with continuous logarithmic distance biases ($-\gamma \cdot \log(1 + d_{ij})$), preventing node isolation while prioritizing local interactions.
- **CTDE (MAPPO) Policy**: Decentralized actor heads execute actions per drone from individual node embeddings, while a centralized value critic evaluates global team states.
- **Intrinsic Explainability**: Multi-layer attention weights are exposed to rank top influential neighbors (drones/obstacles) guiding each maneuver.

## 6. Installation

The project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast and reproducible package management.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 installed
- `uv` installed (`pip install uv` or via the official installer)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Etrlnx/Zippie-RL-UAV-Navigation.git
cd Zippie-RL-UAV-Navigation

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv sync
```

## 7. Usage & Training

### Start Training
Train the Graph Transformer MAPPO policy using the default TOML configuration:
```bash
uv run python train.py --config configs/default.toml
```

### Monitor Training via TensorBoard
```bash
uv run tensorboard --logdir logs
```

## 8. Evaluation & Baseline Comparison

### Evaluate Trained Policy
Evaluate the trained checkpoint across test episodes:
```bash
uv run python evaluate.py --checkpoint checkpoints/best_model.pt --episodes 10

### Benchmark Against Baselines (MLP & CNN)
```bash
uv run python evaluate.py --checkpoint checkpoints/best_model.pt --compare_baselines --episodes 10

```

## 9. Explainability & Attention Visualization

The framework logs multi-head attention matrices to analyze agent coordination and obstacle avoidance:

```python
from explainability.attention_viz import AttentionVisualizer
from explainability.neighbor_analysis import NeighborAnalyzer

visualizer = AttentionVisualizer(config)
analyzer = NeighborAnalyzer(config)

# Extract attention rollout across layers
rollout = visualizer.extract_attention_rollout(attn_weights)
visualizer.plot_attention_matrix(rollout, node_labels=["Drone_0", "Drone_1", "Obs_1", ...])

# Rank top influential entities affecting Drone 0
summary = analyzer.generate_decision_summary("drone_0", 0, "move_forward", rollout, node_metadata)
print(summary["summary_proxy"])
```
